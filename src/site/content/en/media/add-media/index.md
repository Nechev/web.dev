Users like videos; videos can be fun and informative. On mobile devices, videos
can be an easier way to consume information. But videos take bandwidth and they
don't always work the same across every platform. Users don't like waiting for
videos to load; they don't like it when they press play and nothing happens.
Read on to find the simplest way to add video to your site and ensure users get
the best possible experience on any device.

{% Aside %}
This section assumes you have an audio or video file that is ready for embedding
in a web page. An mov file straight off a camera will not work. If an mov file
is all you have, start at the beginning of this section with [Conceptual
basics](../media-experience/) and read through all the background about how
media files are put together and about using command line application to covert
your media files.
