In this section you'll learn how to embedd a media file in a web page using the
`<video>` and `<source>` files, and how to add captions to a video for the
hearing-impaired.

This section assumes you have an audio or video file that is ready for embedding
in a web page. An mov file straight off a camera will not work. If an mov file
is all you have, start at the beginning of this section with [Conceptual
basics](../media-experience/) and read through all the background about how
media files are put together and about using command line application to covert
your media files.
