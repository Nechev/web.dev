You've landed on this page because you're looking to add video to a web site.
There are three approaches you can take.

* Basic embedding using HTML media tags such as &lt;video> and &lt;audio>.
* More complicated embedding using a video library such as [Google's Shaka
  Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player), [JW
  Player](https://developer.jwplayer.com/), or [Video.js](http://videojs.com/).
* Building your own media streaming application.

This site only covers the first, at lease for now. The last item, building a
media streaming application beyond the scope of this site. Frankly, it requries
a team of expert programmers and thousands of human-hours of work. Unless your
goal is to enter that market as a competitor, you're better off using one of the
first two methods.
